              <h2> <pre>It is a universal and global road because its itinerary is developed throughout the main oceans and all the continents in both planet hemispheres. 
The Magellan Route is the way traced by the nautical expedition made by the first world circumnavegation in the dawning of the 16th century. This path was 
organized and led by one of the most extraordinary explorer and sailor ever, Ferdinand Magellan, who for the first time placed in the maps not only a new 
and immense ocean (Pacific), which has then been fully navigated for the first time, but also the Strait that connected the two big oceans in the planet, 
the Atantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. This route was used during four centuries to connect the East and the West through the sea, since it was the only 
possible route used by ships until the construction of the Panama Canal in the 20th century. The valuable contribution of this universal route to the 
human history can be seen not only in the voyage itself, but also in the historical background of the voyage and in the consequences it had in the 
development of several civilisations.</pre></h2>

 among other things. He served on board the galleys of the Knights of Rhodes, and accompanied the papal nuncio, Monsignor Chieregati, to Spain. Later, 
 he joined the Portuguese captain Ferdinand Magellan and his Spanish crew on their trip to the Maluku Islands. While in the Philippines Magellan was 
 killed, and Pigafetta was injured. Nevertheless, he recovered and was among only 18 of Magellan’s original crew who, having completed the first 
 circumnavigation of the world, returned to Spain on board another vessel, the Victoria. Most importantly, Pigafetta kept a journal of his voyage, 
 and this is a key source for information about Magellan’s famous journey. </pre></h1>

              <h1> <pre> On Aug. 10, 1519, Magellan set sail with 270 men and five ships: the Trinidad (commanded by Magellan), the San Antonio, the Victoria, the Conception, 
 and the Santiago. From Spain, the fleet sailed to Brazil and then headed south, hugging the coast.

 <span style="background-color: lightgreen;"> Trinidad </span> was a nao (ship) of 100 tons (or 110 tons, Morrison has both) with square sails on the fore and main masts and a lateen mizzen. Its original 
 crew was 61. After Magellan's death and the burning of the Concepcion, Victoria and Trinidad (the San Antonio and the Santiago being lost earlier) 
 reached Tidore on 8 November 1521.

 <span style="background-color: lightgreen;"> Antonio </span> was a Spanish trading ship built in Cebu under the supervision of European boat-builders. It was docked at the port of Cavite to undergo 
 reconditioning and repair but at the end of October 1600, Don Antonio de Morga, Vice-Governor General of the Philippines, ordered it converted into a 
 warship and renamed it San Diego.

 <span style="background-color: lightgreen;"> Victoria </span> was a Spanish carrack and the first ship to successfully circumnavigate the world. The Victoria was part of a Spanish expedition commanded 
 by the Portuguese, Ferdinand Magellan, and after his demise during the voyage, by Juan Sebastián Elcano. The expedition began with five ships but the 
 Victoria was the only ship to complete the voyage.

 <span style="background-color: lightgreen;"> Concepción </span> was an early-16th-century Spanish carrack, one of the five ships of the Magellan-Elcano expedition to the Spice Islands (the Moluccas). 
 The expedition, finding itself short-handed, burnt the ship in the Philippines in 1521.

 <span style="background-color: lightgreen;"> Santiago </span> (ship) Santiago was an early-16th-century Spanish ship, a carrack, one of the five vessels of the Magellan - Elcano expedition to the Spice 
 Islands (the Moluccas). It was destroyed by a storm when it was sent on a scouting mission during the early stages of the expedition.</pre></h1>

 The Battle of Mactan was a historical event that took place six centuries ago. In April 27, 1521. It is the first known and recorded
 resistance of the Filipinos against foreign forces who aimed to invade and conquer the Philippines.
                
                
 Lapu-Lapu (Baybayin: Abecedario: Lápú-Lápú) was a ruler of Mactan in the Visayas. Modern Philippine society regards him as the first 
 Filipino hero because he was the first native to resist Imperial Spanish colonization. He was born 1491 in Mactan and died 1542, Mactan.
                
 There is an annual commemoration for the battle of Mactan in Mactan in Lapu-Lapu City, this is also the location where you can find

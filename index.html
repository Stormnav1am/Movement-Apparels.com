              <h2> It is a universal and global road because its itinerary
  is developed throughout the main oceans and all the continents in both planet hemispheres. 
The Magellan Route is the way traced by the nautical expedition made by the first world 
circumnavegation in the dawning of the 16th century. This path was 
organized and led by one of the most extraordinary explorer and sailor ever, Ferdinand Magellan, 
who for the first time placed in the maps not only a new 
and immense ocean (Pacific), which has then been fully navigated for the first time, but also the 
Strait that connected the two big oceans in the planet, 
the Atantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. This route was used during four centuries to connect the
East and the West through the sea, since it was the only 
possible route used by ships until the construction of the Panama Canal in the 20th century. 
The valuable contribution of this universal route to the 
human history can be seen not only in the voyage itself, but also in the historical
background of the voyage and in the consequences it had in the 
development of several civilisations.</h2>

 he joined the Portuguese captain Ferdinand Magellan and his Spanish crew on their trip to the Maluku Islands. While in the Philippines Magellan was 
 killed, and Pigafetta was injured. Nevertheless, he recovered and was among only 18 of Magellan’s original crew who, having completed the first 
 circumnavigation of the world, returned to Spain on board another vessel, the Victoria. Most importantly, Pigafetta kept a journal of his voyage, 
 and this is a key source for information about Magellan’s famous journey. </h1>

 warship and renamed it San Diego.

 <span style="background-color: teal;"> Victoria</span> was a Spanish carrack and the first ship to successfully circumnavigate the world. The Victoria was part of a Spanish expedition commanded 
 by the Portuguese, Ferdinand Magellan, and after his demise during the voyage, by Juan Sebastián Elcano. The expedition began with five ships but the 
 Victoria was the only ship to complete the voyage.

 <span style="background-color: teal;"> Concepción</span> was an early-16th-century Spanish carrack, one of the five ships of the Magellan-Elcano expedition to the Spice Islands (the Moluccas).
